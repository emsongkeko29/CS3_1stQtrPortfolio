# Q1 Reflection

## Topics I know very well:
1. Comparison Operators - I found comparison operators easy because we already discussed them a lot last year, and they're pretty easy to apply. Since there are only a few operators, they're not hard to remember, and I use them often in coding, so I don't forget them.
2. JS Basic Statements - I found this topic easy also because it shares similar features to our topics in C++ last year. This topic is pretty easy to understand, and was used the entire quarter.
3. Variable Declaration - I know this topic very well because we have used it repeatedly throughout the quarter in multiple codes. I know this topic very well also because of past lessons regarding different coding languages, as most of them use variable declaration as well.
4. JS in HTML & CSS - I know this topic very well because I already have experience in making websites with HTML and CSS. It was easy for me to apply JS in this.
5. Arithmetic Operators - I remember this topic very well because we have already discussed it last year in C++. Additionally, we also use this topic in most of our codes so it was curcial to understand.

## Topics I don't remember as well:
1. Loops - Even though we "discussed" this in grade 8, I still have trouble applying this in different scenarios due to its complexity. When it stands alone, I am confident in this. However, when combined with functions i often get confused on how to apply them to get the required output.
2. Defining Functions - Just like loops, even though we "discussed" this in grade 8, I also have trouble applying this in different scenarios. Additionally, I'm often confused when or where to place this, especially considering the presence of loops.
3. Processing Functions - With this, I also have the same problem with loops and defining functions. Furthermore, when it gets to this point I often have trouble analyzing and applying this as the code tends to get lengthy.
4. Common Pre-defined functions - I don't remember this topic well, because even though it is pre-defined, I have trouble actually understanding how it works. I believe the lack of understanding can contribute to many errors when coding. 
5. Switch Statement - This topic is not that hard when I study it. However, due to its length, it lowkey intimidates me and makes me forget.

## Plans of Action
1. Loops - To improve, I will continue practicing this as it is crucial in moving forward with JS.
2. Defining Functions - In the future, I will try to apply functions in our different class works to practice, and I will use some of my personal time to practice.
3. Processing Functions - I will continue practicing this along with loops and defining functions, so I can improve my JS moving forward.
4. Common Pre-defined functions - I will look up tutorials or explanations online on why pre-defined functions are a certain way.
5. Switch Statement - I will use the switch statement more often inside and out of class so I can memorize it and stop being scared to use it!

## Class Activities
* Effective
1. Kahoot - I believe this was really effective since the whole class got to bond and have fun, while also learning the things we needed for assessments. I believe this also encouraged people to get the right answers or to study the questions very well because there is a podium.
2. Practice Exercises - I found this very helpful as we got to practice in class, and when problems arose we could ask ma'am Aline for help. Because of this, I answered the graded excercises with ease.

* Not Effective
1. Making some graded exercises due on the weekend - I found this to be ineffective because most students usually take their time on weekends to rest and generally don't expect schoolworks to be submitted at this time. I think this may have caused incomplete submissions among students. I also think this time should be a recovery period to help prepare for the following week of academics.
2. Graded diagnostic exam - While I believe that assessing the students' knowledge is helpful, it shouldn't be graded. I think this exam should only be a non-graded assessment or only a minor quiz. This is because their main purpose is to check what students already know and what they still need to learn.
